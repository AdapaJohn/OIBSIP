        <h1 class="title-Nikola">Biography</h1>
        <h3>Early years </h3>
        <p>
            ❧ Hawking was born in Oxford into a family of physicians. In October 1959, at the age of 17, he began his
            university education at University College, Oxford, where he received a first-class BA degree in physics. In
            October 1962, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall at the University of Cambridge where, in March
            1966, he obtained his PhD degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general
            relativity and cosmology. In 1963, at age 21, Hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing
            form of motor neurone disease that gradually, over decades, paralysed him.[20][21] After the loss of his
            speech, he communicated through a speech-generating device initially through use of a handheld switch, and
            eventually by using a single cheek muscle.

        <h3>Professional works</h3>
        <p>
            ❧ Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity
            theorems in the framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit
            radiation, often called Hawking radiation. Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s
            and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a major breakthrough
            in theoretical physics. Hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the
            general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds
            interpretation of quantum mechanics.

        <h3>Carrer</h3>
        <p>
            ❧ <b>1966-1975</b>
                           In his work, and in collaboration with Penrose, Hawking extended the singularity theorem 
                           concepts first explored in his doctoral thesis. This included not only the existence of
                            singularities but also the theory that the universe might have started as a singularity. 
                            Their joint essay was the runner-up in the 1968 Gravity Research Foundation competition.
                             In 1970, they published a proof that if the universe obeys the general theory of relativity
                              and fits any of the models of physical cosmology developed by Alexander Friedmann, then it 
                              must have begun as a singularity.[86][87][88] In 1969, Hawking accepted a specially created
                               Fellowship for Distinction in Science to remain at Caius. 
        </p>
        <b>1975–1990</b>
        <p>
            ❧ Hawking returned to Cambridge in 1975 to a more academically senior post, as reader in gravitational physics. The mid-to-late 1970s were a period of growing public interest in black holes and the physicists who were studying them. Hawking was regularly interviewed for print and television.[114][115] He also received increasing academic recognition of his work.[116] In 1975, he was awarded both the Eddington Medal and the Pius XI Gold Medal, and in 1976 the Dannie Heineman Prize, the Maxwell Medal and Prize and the Hughes Medal.[117][118] He was appointed a professor with a chair in gravitational physics in 1977.[119] The following year he received the Albert Einstein Medal and an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford.
        </p>
        <b>1990–2000</b>
        <p>
            ❧ Hawking pursued his work in physics: in 1993 he co-edited a book on Euclidean quantum gravity with Gary Gibbons and published a collected edition of his own articles on black holes and the Big Bang.In 1994, at Cambridge's Newton Institute, Hawking and Penrose delivered a series of six lectures that were published in 1996 as "The Nature of Space and Time".In 1997, he conceded a 1991 public scientific wager made with Kip Thorne and John Preskill of Caltech. Hawking had bet that Penrose's proposal of a "cosmic censorship conjecture" – that there could be no "naked singularities" unclothed within a horizon – was correct.

        <h3>Awards, patents and ideas</h3>
        <p>
        <h4> Hawking received numerous awards and honours. They include:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>In 1974 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS)</li>
            <li>Hawking was also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1984),the American Philosophical
                Society (1984) and the United States National Academy of Sciences (1992) </li>
            <li>Hawking received the 2015 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Basic Sciences shared with
                Viatcheslav Mukhanov for discovering that the galaxies were formed from quantum fluctuations in the
                early Universe</li>
            <li> At the 2016 Pride of Britain Awards, Hawking received the lifetime achievement award "for his
                contribution to science and British culture".</li>
            <li>After receiving the award from Prime Minister Theresa May, Hawking humorously requested that she not
                seek his help with Brexit</li>
            <li>The Stephen Hawking Medal for Science Communication is an annual award initiated in 2016 to honour
                members of the arts community for contributions that help build awareness of science</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Death</h3>
        <p>
            ⦿ Hawking died at his home in Cambridge on 14 March 2018, at the age of 76.His family stated that he "died
            peacefully".He was eulogised by figures in science, entertainment, politics, and other areas.The Gonville
            and Caius College flag flew at half-mast and a book of condolences was signed by students and visitors.A
            tribute was made to Hawking in the closing speech by IPC President Andrew Parsons at the closing ceremony of
            the 2018 Paralympic Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.
